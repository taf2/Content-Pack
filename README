Sinatra Static Pages
--------------------

Sinatra makes websites easy, but when it's time to deploy running ruby can be a pain.

ContentPack makes it easy.  Just export your sinatra application as static html and upload to any webserver - Done!

All the power of ruby, but really how many times are you changing that content and why can't you traverse your content store 
before deploying.  Do you really have so many pages you need a database for every request?
